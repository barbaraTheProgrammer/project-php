# small project using data from URL address

This programm is using MySQL, that is why I made it using XAMPP. In this small project I wrote methods which allowes to get data (string) from page and save some of it in database. I used class and objects, to make it work. This is not sophisticated solution, but I't working okey. You always have to start with something :)
