# small project reading data from page - php

This programm is using MySQL, that is why I made it using XAMPP. In this small project I wrote methods which allowes to get data (string) from page and save some of it in database. This program also counts how many items, which already are in database contins given substring - in this case a domain of users e-mail. Another functionality is printing data from database. It's updating, every time you run the programm, according to the database,  I used class and objects, to make it work. This is not sophisticated solution, but It's working okey. You always have to start with something :)
